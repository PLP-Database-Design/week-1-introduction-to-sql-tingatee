## **Assignment Questions**

1. State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)

i. Query Processor - It interprets and executes user requests  
ii. Storage Manager - It controls the storage and retrieval of data but also maintains consistency and integrity of the database  
iii. Disk Storage: It is physical storage for data, data dictionaries, and indices  
iv. Transaction Manager - ensures that database transactions are processed correctly and reliably, even in the event of system failures  

2. What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables, with rows representing records and columns representing attributes. These tables are related to each other through common fields, forming a network of interconnected data. e.g.
i. PostgreSQL  
ii. MySQL  
iii. Oracle Database  
iv. Microsoft SQL Server  

3. State and Explain three classifications of SQL?

i. Data Definition Language (DDL) - Used to define and modify the structure of database objects such as tables, schemas, and indexes.  
ii. Data Manipulation Language (DML) - Focuses on managing data within database tables (inserting, updating, retrieving, or deleting records).  
iii. Data Control Language (DCL) - Deals with permissions and access control. It allows administrators to manage user privileges.  

4. What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?

Primary Key Uniquely identifies each record in a table while a Foreign key Creates a link bewtween tables that connect related data  

5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?

Is a graphical representation of the entities (tables) and relationships between them in a database. It is a useful tool for designing and understanding the structure of a database  

6. What are the advantages of relational databases?

i. Data Integrity - Ensures consistency and accuracy through primary and foreign keys.  
ii. Flexibility - Easy to modify data and relationships without affecting the database structure.  
iii. Security - Supports granular access control and user authentication.  
iv. Scalability - Capable of handling large volumes of data with appropriate optimization.  
v. Efficient Data Retrieval: SQL queries can be used to retrieve specific data quickly and efficiently  

7. State four types of data type used to store data in tables?
   
i. Numeric - INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL (for storing numbers).  
ii. Character/String - VARCHAR, CHAR, TEXT (for storing textual data).  
iii. Date/Time - DATE, DATETIME, TIME, TIMESTAMP.  
iv. Binary - BLOB, BINARY (for storing binary data like images or files).  

8. What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)?  

A DBMS enables end users to create, protect, read, update and delete data in a database. It also manages security, data integrity and concurrency for databases.
